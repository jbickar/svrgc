Feature: Bullseye Pistol Content
  In order to ensure that the Sunnyvale Rod & Gun Club website has the correct content
  As an end user
  I want to check for the existence of content that should appear on the activities/bullseye page

  Scenario: Bullseye Pistol Headings
    Given I am on "activities/bullseye"
    Then I should see the heading "Bullseye Pistol"
    And I should see the heading "Introduction to the League"
    And I should see the heading "Where"
    And I should see the heading "When"
    And I should see the heading "Eligibility"
    And I should see the heading "Information for New Shooters"
    And I should see the heading "Course of Fire"
    And I should see the heading "22 Rimfire"
    And I should see the heading "Center Fire"
    And I should see the heading "Firearms"
    And I should see the heading "Targets"
    And I should see the heading "Alibis"
    And I should see the heading "Scoring"
